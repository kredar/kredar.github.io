I love to read. When I was younger, I was mostly reading fantasy and sci-fi books. It all changed when I read my first nonfiction book. I don't remember why, but I read "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg, and I loved it. It was easy to read, had great true-life stories, and I saw that it could change my own life. I couldn't stop talking about it; I talked about it with my family, friends, and coworkers. I have to admit - it didn't change my life but definitely affected it and got me thinking about good and bad habits in my life and how to control them. Later I read several of Malcolm Gladwell's books and liked them. Nowadays, I mostly read nonfiction books and mostly around [Product Management](https://www.artkreimer.com/Must-read-Books-for-Product-Managers/), leadership, management, and psychology. 

I have divided this list into three categories: 

**Leadership/Management** are books on the art of leading people & teams and managing projects.

**Inspirational/Self-help** are books that you read and get inspired to do more, to do something bigger. In this category, you would find biographies, memoirs, self-development books, and some inspirational novels. 

**Know the past** - These are history books. As [Carl Sagan](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/194992-you-have-to-know-the-past-to-understand-the-present,) famously said, 

>You have to know the past to understand the present." I would add to it, "You have to know the past to understand the present and build a better future."
