Creativity: AI can replicate and optimize existing solutions, but humans have the ability to create entirely new ideas and concepts. AI is being trained on human data.
Ethics and Morality: AI lacks the ability to make ethical and moral decisions, which is critical in fields such as law, medicine and social workers.
Adaptability: Humans can quickly adapt to changing situations and environments, whereas AI may struggle without prior programming or training. A couple of years back, Elon Musk had to replace robots with people. 
Empathy: AI lacks the ability to understand and empathize with human experiences, which is critical in many fields such as counselling and social work.
Emotional Intelligence: AI lacks the ability to understand and interpret human emotions, which is critical in many fields such as healthcare and customer service.
Contextual Understanding: AI only knows as much as the data it is provided. While AI can process vast amounts of data, it often lacks the ability to understand the context and meaning behind that data.
Intuition: Humans have the ability to make decisions based on intuition and experience, which is difficult for AI to replicate.
Common Sense: AI is highly specialized and lacks the broad common sense that humans possess, which is useful in decision-making and problem-solving.
