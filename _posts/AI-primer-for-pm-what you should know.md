## Introduction

I think the most important thing everyone should understand the probabilistic nature of AI models. AI/ML models are not simple if then software - they are not deterministic in nature, and in many cases, they can produce different results with a small change in the training data or input data. this is where you would hear precision and accuracy and the F1 score of the model - all to describe how well the model performs and compare it with other models. In some cases, the complexity of algorithms,  data availability and data requirements would challenge training the model and improving its performance. 

## Key Considerations Before Embarking on an AI Product Journey
Multiple critical factors have to be considered before you dive into developing an AI-powered product. Understanding these can be the difference between a successful launch and a missed opportunity. 

Here are some pivotal elements to keep in mind:

**Identifying AI Opportunities** - Make sure the AI solution addresses a genuine customer need rather than merely finding an excuse to use an advanced AI model.
- Conduct market research to identify gaps or pain points that AI can solve.
- Validate the idea with stakeholders and potential users.
- **"Fall in love with the problem and not with the solution"** - Don't implement AI for the sake of adding AI to your product.

**Finding the Right Partner** - Developing AI/ML applications requires specialized expertise. Finding the right partner is crucial whether you look inside your organization or seek an external vendor.
- Evaluate potential partners based on their previous work and their expertise in the domain.
- Ensure that the partner aligns with your organization's culture and goals.

**Data Is Key** - If you have to build your model, the right data and its quality would be of the utmost importance. Data is the backbone of any AI project and is crucial for training models. In many cases, continuous training might also be necessary to adapt to new data patterns.

- Ensure you have access to the right amount of a high-quality and relevant data.
- Consider the ethical implications and legal requirements associated with data collection and usage, more about it in my next [post](/AI-primer-for-pm-part2). 

**AI-Application Fit** - Understanding the pros and cons of various AI and ML techniques is essential. Discuss with your partner to choose the most appropriate algorithm for your specific problem and use case.

- Perform a feasibility analysis to identify the most effective AI or ML techniques.
- Keep scalability, cost, and performance in mind when choosing algorithms.

**Resource Allocation** - Be clear about the human and computational resources required to bring your AI project to life.
- Create a detailed project timeline and budget.
- Consider the long-term maintenance costs of the AI system.

## Conclusion
AI offers numerous opportunities for innovation in product management. Awareness of its possibilities can significantly benefit your role as a Product Manager. Be curious, follow AI trends, learn and create products that solve customer pain points and delight customers with the help of AI/ML features and algorithms.
