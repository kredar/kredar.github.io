    title: "Here are some of my takeaways:"
    excerpt: "<br>
1. What people say and what they think and do is not the same. And because of that, you must rely on qualitative and quantitative analysis. <br><br>
2. It’s hard to predict what would struct a chord with your customers - constantly design and conduct AB tests to optimize messages and product features.<br><br>
3. Don’t mix correlation with causation. Correlation is simply a relation of A and B, while causation explicitly applies to cases where action A causes outcome B.<br><br>"

I just finished my first book of 2022 - ["Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are"](https://amzn.to/3EasBeK) by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. 

It's an easy read full of insights into human behaviour, and it reminded me of [Freakonomics](https://amzn.to/3LuM64D) by Steven D. Levitt. Although I can't entirely agree with all the observations and conclusions, I enjoyed it and would recommend reading it.
