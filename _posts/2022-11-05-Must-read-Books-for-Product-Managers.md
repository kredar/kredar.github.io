I love reading books. Books are containers of knowledge and wisdom - we can all learn something from every book we read.

> "Reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary." - Jim Rohn
> "If you are going to get anywhere in life you have to read a lot of books." - Roald Dahl
> "Think before you speak. Read before you think." - Fran Lebowitz
> "Today a reader, tomorrow a leader." - Margaret Fuller

There are a lot of great books out there, and there are a lot of books on Product Management. But what are the must-reads for Product Managers?

I recently found this great book recommendation visual guide on [Delibr](https://www.delibr.com/post/visual-guide-to-the-best-books-on-product-management). 

<figure style="width: 50%" class="align-center">

</figure>
<!-- {% include figure image_path="/assets/images/Best Product Management Books Guide.png" alt="Best Books for PMs by Delibr" caption="Visual Guide to the best books on product management" %} -->

Although I agree with most of these book recommendations, I would like to expand and add more books to the list. I might even update the visual at some point.

So here are additional must-read books for Product Managers.

## Communication And Collaboration  

Communication and collaboration are the most crucial skills for PMs at any level. 

{% include feature_row id="feature_row1" %} 

## UX/UI Design 

PMs are a connecting tissue between business, design and technology. They work with Product designers regularly and need a solid understanding of UX best practices.  

{% include feature_row id="feature_row2" %} 

## Analytics and Customer insights  

Great PMs can leverage qualitative and quantitative data to get deep inside into customer behaviours and their needs and leverage it to create the best possible value for their product.  

{% include feature_row id="feature_row3" %} 

## Strategic Thinking  

To create great products, PMs need to define a great product vision and create a good strategy to achieve this vision.  

{% include feature_row id="feature_row4" type="left" %} 

## Leadership  

PMs not only motivate product team members, but also provide thought leadership and mentorship to younger PMs and actively assist them in expanding and developing skills and knowledge.  

{% include feature_row id="feature_row5" %} 

## Technical Knowledge  

PMs need to have at least basic knowledge of the technical stack their product was build on and have a basic understanding on how internet works.  

{% include feature_row id="feature_row6" type="left" %} 

## Best Practices and Culture  

There are many approaches to product management, leadership and company culture. These are some great books to expand on these topics.  

{% include feature_row id="feature_row7" %}
