**Hi there!** ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Art (Artiom) Kreimer, a product leader with over a decade of experience leading cross-functional teams to build AI-powered digital products. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Communication Systems Engineering and have worked across diverse industries, including ASIC, consumer electronics, telecom, web and mobile apps, machine learning, conversational AI, and finance.

Currently, Iâ€™m the Director of Product Management at Guidepoint, where I lead the development of AI-powered products. Iâ€™m passionate about using data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to solve real-world customer challenges and create meaningful value.

Previously, I led product strategy and development for data and AI-driven initiatives at [Scotiabank](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal.html). Before that, I played a key role in building conversational AI and chatbot analytics platforms at [Wysdom.AI](https://wysdom.ai/) (Aquired by Calabrio).

I live in Ontario, Canada, with my wife, two daughters, and a Hungarian Vizsla. In my free time, I enjoy being with my family and exploring the outdoors through hiking, running, and nature adventures. Iâ€™m also an avid reader and lifelong learner.

Want to learn more about my experience, skills, certifications, and aspirations? Ask my personal **[ResumeGPT Chatbot](https://www.artkreimer.com/resume/)** or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artkreimer/).
