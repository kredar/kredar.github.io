The majority of this post was written mid-last year, and based on a presentation I gave in response to significant concerns about AI taking our jobs, especially following the release of ChatGPT. Last week, during a conversation with an advisor at my bank, I mentioned that I am working on introducing new AI-based features into Scotiabank's digital products. Her strong reaction, expressing fear about AI knowing too much and posing a threat, prompted me to revisit this topic and finally publish this blog post.

I have always been a passionate techno-optimist[^1], particularly about the potential of AI. While the future portrayed in Terminator was entertaining and raised concerns, I genuinely believe in AI's immense potential to benefit our world. Recent revelations by Geoffrey Hinton[^2] have tempered my pure optimism, moving me towards a position of cautious optimism or pragmatic realism. However, I am far from being an AI doomer.

Though I believe AI practitioners should reinforce guardrails and closely monitor our journey toward true AGI, we are still quite far away from achieving it. I see AI as a catalyst for human progress and an augmentation of human intellect. As Andrew Ng famously said, "AI is a new electricity"[^3], transforming and changing many aspects of our lives. From fully self-driving cars to advanced medical diagnosis, AI is already changing the way we live and work. While the transformative power of AI is exciting, it's crucial to acknowledge some of the challenges that come with it.

Beyond doomsday predictions, a significant concern is AI's impact on the job market and the potential elimination or transformation of certain jobs. Unfortunately it's true - some professions will become obsolete. Historically, with the introduction of new technologies, people had to shift and change to other proffessions. Telegram operators, phone switchboard operators, manual bookkeepers, and camera film developers are examples of professions that no longer exist, yet society has benefited from technological advancements.

On a global scale, we live far better lives compared to 100 years ago. We have eradicated many illnesses, the number of people living in poverty and hunger is constantly decreasing. Majority of this advancements can be attribute to the advancements in technology, including AI algorithms[^4]. So yes, AI is going to replace some of our jobs, but majority of humans would benefit from these changes. 

Let's talk a little bit about what AI algorithms are lacking and what I think would be really hard to replicate using AI. First of all, AI is just algorithm that is based on human inputs. Without human data AI is nothing. In the recent study researches showed that training model on the AI generated data resulted in model not generalizing, forgeting and eventually collapsing[^6]. Current AI algorithms need our data to be useful. They can proccess data, predict outcomes,  write text, create images but it's pure mathematics and lacks many of the human traits that are crucial for some jobs. Here are some of them:

1. **Creativity**: AI can replicate and optimize existing solutions, but humans have the ability to create entirely new ideas and concepts. This point is highly debatable starting from the definitions of `Creativity` to AI abilities to be creative. My view that current AI is not creative yet. 
2. **Ethics and Morality**: AI lacks the ability to make ethical and/or moral decisions, which is critical in fields such as law, medicine, psychology and social work. One of the huge problems with AI algorithms is bias we have in our data that can have ethical implication.  
3. **Adaptability**: Humans can quickly adapt to changing situations and environments, whereas AI may struggle without prior programming or training. Humans can generalize and react much faster to totally new, never seen situations. They can make mistakes but AI might not even react to this new change because it never had it in it's data. Self driving car might not recognize stop sign with  know what to do because this A couple of years back, Tesla had to rollback their plans and replace some of their robots with humans.[^5]
4. **Empathy**: AI lacks the ability to understand and empathize with human experiences, which is critical in many fields such as counselling and social work.
5. **Emotional Intelligence**: AI lacks the ability to understand and interpret human emotions, which is critical in healthcare and customer service.
6. **Contextual Understanding**: AI only knows as much as the data it is provided. While AI can process vast amounts of data, it often lacks the ability to understand the context and meaning behind that data.
7. **Intuition**: Humans have the ability to make decisions based on intuition and experience, which is difficult for AI to replicate.
8. **Common Sense**: AI is highly specialized and lacks the broad common sense that humans possess, which is useful in decision-making and problem-solving. It can generalize like we humans can at least not yet. 

So don't be afraid of AI - embrace it. We are far away from AI replacing us. Use AI based tools for your advantage and think about your future and the future of your proffession and what role AI will play in it. In recent years, there has been an explosion of new AI tools on the market. From text generation and image/audio recognition/generation to predictive analytics, these tools are revolutionizing the way businesses operate and providing new opportunities for innovation and growth. If you need to create content, explore ChatGPT, Copy.ai, Jasper. If you are a software developer, try Codex, Github copilot, or ChatGPT to learn or bootstrap new algorithms. Need a new image for your blog? Check Dall-e, Stable Diffusion or Midjourney. Posibilities are endles. Embrace the power of AI and constantly learn and adapt. Yuval Noah Harari, the author of "21 lessons for the 21st century", predicts jobs will change every 10 or 15 years. As a result, we will have to reinvent ourselves professionally several times during our lifetime.
